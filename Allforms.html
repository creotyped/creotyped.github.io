              To optimize both UX and UI, a set of measures was carried
              out to identify the user’s real pains and problems. The new
              process was designed to provide the team with insights and a
              list of priority problems that needed to be eliminated as
              quickly as possible. A number of user studies were
              conducted, on the basis of which we developed:

                Two weeks after the start of work, the team was presented with a new concept for the main user scenario. After conducting corridor tests and making sure of the basic adequacy of the new UX, usability testing was organized with users of 7 people.
              </p>
              <p data-i18n="AllForms_desc_solution1_paragraph5">
                Users were asked to go through an interactive prototype to solve their main tasks, such as creating a questionnaire, setting it up, sorting and editing it. During this event, usability metrics were collected, such as the speed and success of completing a task, the number of clicks, as well as the subjective feelings of respondents.

              <p data-i18n="AllForms_desc_solution1_paragraph6">
                As a result, all users successfully completed the tasks, users were able to solve their problems 43% faster than in the old version of the design, and also 15% faster than the competitive solutions with which the comparison was made. In addition, some feature branches showed particularly high performance, such as the “share access” functionality, in comparison with competitors, showed a result of 155% speedup in completing the task of this task.

                No critical problems were identified in the new version, but the team picked up a number of insights and ideas for the next versions of the product, and was also convinced of the feasibility, importance and correctness of the upcoming global changes.

            My integration into the project as a design lead allowed for effective communication and collaboration within the team. We introduced a system of regular synchronizations, thanks to which we improved coordination and speed of work, ensuring smooth and accurate implementation of design into development.

                The designer was motivated and put on the path to testing hypotheses and a product approach. We managed to establish high-quality communication with the team through regular synchronization and demonstration of ideas and concepts.
