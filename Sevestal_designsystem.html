              The Severstal design system is a project that emerged from my
              initiative. The company produces a large number of products in
              different areas, but all this time it did not have a system design
              in any form, which is why most of the products looked
              heterogeneous, and the development teams had to implement UI kits
              from scratch each time.

                The company and colleagues did not understand the urgent need
                for system design. The first thing we had to deal with was
                proving the feasibility of the company’s investments in this
                project, as well as allocating people for implementation.

                After preparing and analyzing the competitive field, I prepared
                a series of presentations for management, in which I outlined in
                numbers the advantages of having a design system. Having held
                several (150 and 5 is also a few; I would give a specific
                number) such meetings, I was able to convey the importance of
                the problem, after which the company allocated funds and people
                (how many units? How many people?).

                After we managed to obtain funds and a team was identified, we began work. However, it soon became clear that a related division was developing its own design system for a number of projects aimed at import substitution. Management thought it would be a good idea to combine these two activities, which I did not agree with, but I could not convince management of this. Now, instead of 1 design system designed for Severstal projects, it was necessary to create, in fact, 2 systems in one. The problem was exacerbated by the presence of pre-developed components from another team.

                Through a huge number of meetings and synchronizations, we managed to build a process of interaction with all interested parties. Our team took the initiative to maintain the essence of the design system, while our colleagues switched to developing scenarios for their products. Synchronizing simultaneously with the requirements of our products and the requirements of our colleagues’ products, we managed, at the cost of enormous forces (I would remove the huge forces, these are emotions and they can work against you), to implement universal components that, using tokens, can be globally restructured and meet both the company’s needs and and narrow requests of related departments.

                The first step was to find a way to upload through a third-party plugin in Figma. The developer was given a css file containing a set of variables, he processed them and integrated them into the storybook. It was fast, but still not fast enough to be called optimal.
                <p data-i18n="Severstal_desc_solution3_paragraph2">A few months after the start, the team implemented its own plugin for Figma, which allows direct synchronization of tokens with the storybook via the API, for which you just need to fill out a couple of fields and press a button.

                The company did not have established principles by which the dark theme works. The brand book did not provide colors for this, but most of the customers wanted to have this function available, which is why we had many different dark themes made at the discretion of different teams.

                During synchronization with the branding department, we managed to prove (use active verbs! Not “we managed to prove”, but “our team proved A and B”) the need to refine the brand book and introduce a common standard for a dark theme in the company’s interfaces. This standard has been integrated into the design system.
